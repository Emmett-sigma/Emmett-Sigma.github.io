		<p>I can be a leader,<br>But I may follow you,<br>I don't need validation,<br>I do however appreciate it,<br>I'm don't talk much,<br>But you can talk to me,<br>I need space and peace,<br>I'm pragmatic and expressive,<br>I'm everything and nothing,<br>I'm hated and loved,<br>I'd rather talk to one that can appreciate me,<br>even if I don't know them,<br>I change many times over,<br>but my core values remain,<br>I no longer do what others expect,<br>I've shaped my ego to be my pleasant friend,<br>I'm an introvert but will leave a door open,<br>I'm made different and you can be jealous or proud of that,<br>It shows me who you are,<br>I'm a Sigma male struggling with the dragon of adversity...
